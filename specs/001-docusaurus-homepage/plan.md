# Implementation Plan: Docusaurus Homepage Design

**Branch**: `001-docusaurus-homepage` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: [specs/001-docusaurus-homepage/spec.md](specs/001-docusaurus-homepage/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-docusaurus-homepage/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a modern, visually appealing homepage for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook using Docusaurus framework. The implementation will include a hero section with gradient background, module cards for the four main course components (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA), learning outcomes, hardware requirements, and a call-to-action button. The design will follow the specified color palette (Electric Blue #1A73E8, Neon Green #39FF14, Violet Radiance #8B5CF6) with responsive design and smooth animations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js v18+ (for Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3.x, React 18+, Node.js, npm/yarn
**Storage**: N/A (static site generation, no database required)
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
**Project Type**: Static web application (frontend only)
**Performance Goals**: Page load time < 3 seconds, 95% Lighthouse performance score, smooth animations
**Constraints**: Must be accessible, SEO-friendly, responsive across all device sizes
**Scale/Scope**: Static content for course homepage, expected low server load (static hosting)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Accuracy Check
✅ **PASS**: Implementation will use official Docusaurus documentation and GitHub resources as primary sources. All code will be based on verified Docusaurus patterns and React best practices.

### Clarity Check
✅ **PASS**: Implementation will target developers familiar with React and modern web frameworks. Documentation will be clear and concise with proper examples.

### Reproducibility Check
✅ **PASS**: All code snippets will be executable within the Docusaurus framework. Static site generation ensures reproducible builds. Implementation will follow Docusaurus conventions for consistency.

### Rigor Check
✅ **PASS**: Using open-source tools (Docusaurus, React, Node.js) with proper citations to official documentation and GitHub repositories. All dependencies are open-source and well-maintained.

### Compliance Summary
All constitutional gates pass. Implementation will adhere to:
- Primary source verification through official Docusaurus documentation
- Executable code snippets that work within the Docusaurus framework
- Open-source tools with proper citations
- Accessibility and SEO best practices as per Docusaurus guidelines

### Source Code (repository root)

└── ...                 # Other static files

package.json            # Project dependencies and scripts
docusaurus.config.js    # Docusaurus configuration
sidebars.ts             # Navigation configuration
tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
```

**Structure Decision**: The implementation will use the existing Docusaurus project structure with modifications to the homepage (src/pages/index.tsx), addition of the HomepageFeatures component (src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx), and custom CSS styling (src/css/custom.css) to implement the specified design requirements.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
