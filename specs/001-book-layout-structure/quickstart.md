# Quickstart: Book Layout and Structure Generation

This guide provides a quick overview of how to generate and view the book's layout and structure using Docusaurus.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version) installed
- npm or Yarn installed
- Git installed

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the Docusaurus dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

## 3. Generate Book Structure (using MCP/CLI)

The book structure (modules, chapters, sections) will be generated by the Context7 MCP system, potentially triggered by the Gemini CLI. Assuming the generation process is already configured, running the relevant command will populate the `/docs` directory.

Example (conceptual, actual command may vary):

```bash
gemini-cli generate-book-structure
```

This command will create:
-   `/docs/modules/module-1/`, `/docs/modules/module-2/`, etc.
-   `preface.md`, `toc.md`, `appendices.md`, `glossary.md` in `/docs/`

## 4. Start Docusaurus Development Server

Once the markdown files are generated, you can start the Docusaurus development server to preview the book:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This will open a new browser window with your Docusaurus site, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the markdown files will be reflected live.

## 5. Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of your Docusaurus site, run:

```bash
npm run build # or yarn build
```

This command generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into the `build` directory, which can then be deployed to a web server or GitHub Pages.

## 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Conceptual)

Deployment to GitHub Pages will be handled by the GitHub MCP, typically as part of a CI/CD pipeline triggered by commits to the `master` or `main` branch.

**(Note: Specific CI/CD configuration will be detailed in the `plan.md` and related documentation.)**
