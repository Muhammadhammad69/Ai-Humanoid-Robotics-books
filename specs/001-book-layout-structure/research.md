# Research: Book Layout and Structure

## Research Tasks

### 1. Define Specific Performance Goals

**Task**: Research and define specific performance goals for the Docusaurus website, beyond the default settings.

**Findings**:

- **Decision**: We will adopt the following performance goals, based on Google's Core Web Vitals:
    - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: below 2.5 seconds.
    - **First Input Delay (FID)**: below 100 milliseconds.
    - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: below 0.1.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to Core Web Vitals ensures a good user experience and is a recognized industry standard. Docusaurus is already optimized for performance, so these goals are achievable.
- **Alternatives considered**: We considered setting more aggressive goals, but without specific requirements for high-traffic scenarios, sticking to the Core Web Vitals provides a solid baseline.

## Consolidated Findings

The primary area requiring clarification was performance goals. The research has resulted in the adoption of Google's Core Web Vitals as the performance standard for the project. This decision provides clear, measurable targets for the website's performance.
