Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Module 2 Content & Layout Goal: - Generate **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Create the **full layout** (chapters, sections, subsections) - Populate **complete content** for each chapter - Maintain consistency with Module 1 structure and book style --- # 1. Module Overview **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** Focus: Physics simulation and environment building. Students will learn: - How to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo - High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity - Sensor simulation: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs - How the digital twin connects to Module 1’s ROS 2 systems and prepares for Module 3’s AI perception --- # 2. Chapters & Sections Module 2 must have **5 chapters** (example structure — flexible): 1. **Introduction to Digital Twins** - What is a digital twin - Importance in humanoid robotics - Integration with ROS 2 2. **Gazebo Physics Simulation** - Setting up Gazebo - Physics engine: gravity, collisions, friction - World building basics - Integrating URDF robots from Module 1 3. **Unity High-Fidelity Rendering** - Creating humanoid environments - Realistic lighting and rendering - Human-robot interaction simulation - Importing Gazebo or ROS 2 models 4. **Sensor Simulation** - LiDAR simulation - Depth cameras and RGB-D sensors - IMU simulation - Interfacing simulated sensors with ROS 2 nodes 5. **Hands-On Mini Projects** - Building a digital twin environment - Simulating a humanoid robot navigating obstacles - Integrating physics, rendering, and sensors --- # 3. Chapter Template Each chapter must follow **this structure** (same as Module 1): # [Chapter Title] ## Overview Explain the chapter, its relevance, and connection to Module 1. --- ## Learning Objectives - Clear, concrete objective 1 - Clear, concrete objective 2 - Clear, concrete objective 3 --- ## Key Concepts ### Concept 1 Accurate explanation ### Concept 2 Accurate explanation ### Concept 3 Accurate explanation --- ## Technical Deep Dive Authoritative exposition, technical examples, and code blocks --- ## Code Examples ```python # Placeholder for Python / ROS 2 / Unity scripts --- # 4. Accuracy Requirements - All content must be verified against **official documentation**: - Gazebo Tutorials and Docs - Unity Robotics Hub Docs - ROS 2 integration guides - Sensor simulation references - No hallucinated commands or APIs - Code examples must be **runnable** in standard ROS 2 + Gazebo + Unity setups - Diagrams must reflect physics and sensor concepts --- # 5. Output Requirements - Generate **full Module 2 layout** (chapter files, placeholders) - Populate **all chapters with complete content** (Markdown, code blocks, diagrams, exercises, references) - Maintain consistency with Module 1 style, terminology, and formatting - Output ready to drop into `/docs/module-2/` for Docusaurus - No content from Modules 1, 3, or 4"
