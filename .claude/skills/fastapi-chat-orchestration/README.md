# FastAPI Chat Orchestration Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building FastAPI-based chat orchestration services.

## Overview

The fastapi-chat-orchestration skill helps you:
- Set up FastAPI for chat applications with proper async handling
- Create orchestration endpoints for chat services
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Handle authentication and security for chat services
- Integrate with ChatKit frontend and backend services
- Implement background tasks for message processing
- Build streaming responses for chat interactions

## Components

- `SKILL.md` - Main skill documentation with usage instructions
- `references/fastapi-reference.md` - Detailed FastAPI documentation
- `references/chatkit-integration.md` - ChatKit integration examples
- `scripts/setup-chat-orchestration.sh` - Utility script to set up a new FastAPI chat project

## Usage

When you need to implement a FastAPI-based chat orchestration service:

1. Use the code examples from `SKILL.md` as starting points
2. Refer to `fastapi-reference.md` for detailed FastAPI features
3. Check `chatkit-integration.md` for ChatKit integration patterns
4. Use `setup-chat-orchestration.sh` to bootstrap new projects
