## Prompt

/sp.plan

You are planning **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.  
The goal: create a complete, publish-ready Module 1 with chapters, sections, examples, diagrams, and references — fully compatible with Docusaurus documentation structure.

Your plan must include:

---

## 1. **Module Scope & Boundaries**
Clearly define:
- What Module 1 will cover.
- What will NOT be included (reserved for Modules 2–4).
- Depth level (student audience: beginners to intermediate robotics students).
- Expected learning outcomes.

---

## 2. **Architecture of Module 1**
Break down the structure:
- Chapters  
- Sub-sections  
- Hands-on exercises  
- Diagrams / illustrations  
- Code samples (Python + ROS 2)  
- ROS packages and file structure  
- URDF examples  

Ensure the layout maps directly to:
	- /docs/module-1/
	- chapter-1.md
	- chapter-2.md

---

## 3. **Research Strategy**
Define how you will gather accurate information:
- ROS 2 Foxy/Humble official documentation
- URDF Reference documentation
- ROS 2 Tutorials (nodes, topics, services)
- rclpy official examples
- Humanoid robotics papers (URDF + kinematics)
- GitHub examples of humanoid URDFs

Include:
- What needs deep research?
- What needs only high-level confirmation?
- What can be generated by AI safely?

---

## 4. **Documentation Workflow (Docusaurus)**
Plan how Module 1 will be generated and integrated:
- Folder structure  
- Sidebar configuration  
- Linking between chapters  
- Image/diagram assets folder  
- Version control handling  

---

## 5. **MCP Workflow (Context7 + GitHub MCP)**
Include **how the book is produced using MCP tools**:
- Using Context7 MCP to:
  - create files  
  - read/write docs  
  - update sidebar  
  - scaffold directories  
- GitHub MCP to:
  - commit  
  - push  
  - handle branches  
  - publish to GitHub Pages  

Explain:
- Which steps are automated  
- Which steps require human oversight  

---

## 6. **Quality Validation Plan**
Define what “good” Module 1 output must pass:
- Technical accuracy (ROS 2 correct APIs)  
- No hallucinated ROS commands  
- URDF validates with `check_urdf`  
- All code examples must run  
- Clear illustrations  
- No missing chapters  
- Learning path must feel progressive  

Include:
- Validation checklists  
- Peer review steps  
- Rendering tests in Docusaurus  

---

## 7. **Decisions & Tradeoffs**
Document decisions such as:
- Which ROS version to follow  
- How deep to go into robotics math  
- Whether to include CLI tools  
- Whether to include simulation previews in Module 1  

Each decision must include:
- Options  
- Pros/cons  
- Why the chosen option is selected  

---

## 8. **Risks & Mitigations**
Examples:
- Hallucinated API → use official doc cross-checks  
- Broken GitHub Pages deploy → test on local environment first  
- ROS examples failing → test in container  
- Diagrams unclear → regenerate with tool  

---

## 9. **Outputs Required**
The planning output must produce:
- A step-by-step roadmap  
- Task breakdown for /sp.tasks  
- Clear instructions for the /sp.implement phase  
- File structure for Module 1  

---

## 10. **Format Requirements**
Return the plan as:
- Markdown  
- Structured  
- With headings/subheadings  


Focus ONLY on **planning**, not writing actual module content.

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" has been successfully generated.

**Branch Name**: `002-ros2-robot-nervous-system`
**Implementation Plan File**: `specs/002-ros2-robot-nervous-system/plan.md`

**Generated Artifacts**:
*   `specs/002-ros2-robot-nervous-system/spec.md`
*   `specs/002-ros2-robot-nervous-system/plan.md`
*   `specs/002-ros2-robot-nervous-system/checklists/requirements.md`

The plan is now ready for the next phase: task breakdown (`/sp.tasks`).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implementation plan for Module 1 of the Robotics course generated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A at this stage.
- 📁 Files: Updated plan.md and GEMINI.md.
