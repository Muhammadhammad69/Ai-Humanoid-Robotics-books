# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Gemini CLI and Spec-Kit Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
Accuracy through primary source verification and real-world examples.

### II. Clarity
Clarity for technical audience (developers familiar with AI tools).

### III. Reproducibility
All code snippets executable, specs traceable to Spec-Kit Plus artifacts.

### IV. Rigor
Open-source tools preferred, with citations to GitHub repos.

## Key Standards

- All factual claims must be traceable to sources like Gemini docs or Spec-Kit Plus templates.
- Citation format: Markdown links with [source] anchors.
- Source types: minimum 60% official docs (e.g., Gemini CLI GitHub, Docusaurus guides).
- Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance, original content only.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10 for accessibility.

## Project Constraints & Success Criteria

### Constraints
- Word count: 8,000-12,000 words across 10 chapters.
- Minimum 20 sources (e.g., AI CLI updates, deployment best practices).
- Format: MDX files for Docusaurus, with embedded code blocks and Mermaid diagrams.

### Success Criteria
- All claims verified against sources and executable code.
- Zero plagiarism detected via tools like Copyleaks.
- Passes AI-assisted review (e.g., Gemini subagent fact-check).

## Governance

- This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
- All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
- Complexity must be justified.
