# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). This module focuses on creating comprehensive simulation environments for humanoid robots using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering. You'll learn how to build digital twins that accurately represent physical robot systems, enabling safe and efficient development, testing, and validation of robotic algorithms.

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that allow for simulation, analysis, and optimization without the risks and costs associated with physical testing. In humanoid robotics, digital twins are essential for developing complex behaviors, testing control algorithms, and training AI perception systems in a controlled environment.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept and importance of digital twins in humanoid robotics
- Master Gazebo physics simulation for realistic robot-environment interactions
- Create high-fidelity visualizations using Unity for enhanced human-robot interaction
